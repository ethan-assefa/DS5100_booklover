# DS5100_booklover
The Git repository I have created for the M09 HW:

* Create a new git repo for your package.
* Create and edit the required files and directories for your package and move the booklover modules there.
* Stage, commit, and push all the files you've created.
* Install your package with pip.
* Outside of your package dir, write a script to test your method.

It contains a package based off the work that we did to create the Booklover Class in M08. All this work is for the DS5100 course at the UVA SDS.
